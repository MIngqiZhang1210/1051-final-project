# 1051-final-project Mingqi Zhang 12/10/01
Here is my cis 1051 final project.
My project is a game. It's name BIgger Snake Box.
This game need you change direction to get socres. When you get higher scores, the speed will faster.
When the snake box's head touch body, game and you will get your finally scores. 
Good luck!


The most difficult part is to control the snake's movement, for a long time learning. This project is my first project of cs, I think this is not perfect, but through this project I learned that cs is not a technology to learn through a teacher, but through my own continuous learning and debugging to keep up with my skills.
Now I think that as a real programmer, you should first respect programming and love the program you write down, he is your partner, not a tool.
