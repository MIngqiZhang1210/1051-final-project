Here is my cis 1051 final project.
My project is about a trade robot. 
When I was in high school, I bought a used graphics card for $100 to play games - the Rx580. two years ago the value of this used graphics card rose to $400 and I sold it through eBay. I used the $400 to join the cryptocurrency. I made $1,000 this way, and not satisfied with the pace, I began to use leverage tools to amplify my gains. Perhaps God blessed me, I made $10,000 in a month, after which I was so aggressive that the ups and downs made my operations very silly. I started to operate heavily. The money got smaller and smaller, and finally my account balance became 0.

In the ups and downs, humans are sometimes stupid and we can't stick to our strategies and end up not making money. But robots are emotionless and their execution of strategies is not affected by ups and downs.
