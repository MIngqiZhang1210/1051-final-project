## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Here is my cis 1051 final project. My project is about a trade robot. When I was in high school, I bought a used graphics card for $100 to play games - the Rx580. two years ago the value of this used graphics card rose to $400 and I sold it through eBay. I used the $400 to join the cryptocurrency. I made $1,000 this way, and not satisfied with the pace, I began to use leverage tools to amplify my gains. Perhaps God blessed me, I made $10,000 in a month, after which I was so aggressive that the ups and downs made my operations very silly. I started to operate heavily. The money got smaller and smaller, and finally my account balance became 0.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

solo project

## Do you have any questions of your own?

There is no perfect trading strategy in the world and I cannot guarantee that my trading strategy will always be profitable. My strategy is to divide my capital into 30 parts and buy if it goes down by 5 percent and sell if it goes up by 5 percent.
